These guidelines are being proposed for use in USGIN for broader model development and documentation. This is a ‘living document’ that will be revised and updated as practice evolves.\r\n\r\n\r\n### NGDS Tier 3 Services Help Files\r\nPlease see [NGDS Tier 3 Service Names, Layer Names, and URI tokens](https://github.com/ngds/documents/wiki/NGDS-Tier-3-Service-Names,-Layer-Names,-and-URI-tokens) for tables describing NGDS tier 3 service naming conventions, mandatory layer names for those services, and tokens to be used in URIs for a given service. [Name authorities](https://github.com/ngds/documents/wiki/NGDS-URI-Name-Authorities) for given data providers are also listed for use in forming URIs for tier 3 datasets.\r\n\r\nThese tier 3 service specifications are governed by information exchanges for each data type. To form a new information exchange for a type of geothermally-relevant data, and more information in general about information exchanges, see https://github.com/usgin/usginspecs/wiki/_pages.\r\n\r\nThe direct location of final version 1 NGDS documentation is available on a single GitHub page; see http://ngds.github.io/documents/NGDS_v1_documentation.htm.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
